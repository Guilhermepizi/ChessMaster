  Ready to Play, Enjoy!!!<p>
  
## How to Play:
<p> You must select the piece you want to move by typing the coordinate.<br>
For example, if you want to move a pawn that is in a2, you type a2<br>
Than type the position you want to move(Target), for example a3.<br>
Wait for the oponent to do the same<br>
Wins who capture the king of the oponent<p>

## Curiosities:
<p> The game have special treatments for error, with diferent sintaxe and answer for wich error.<br>
The game give the posible moves for the chosen piece.<br>
Was created advanced rules:<br>
. How to promote a pawn<br>
. En passant<br>
. Castling.<p>

## Basic Chess Rules:

In chess, each player takes turns to make a single move. Players cannot choose to skip a turn - they must move a piece.<br>
Each chess piece moves in a specific way, and must be moved according to its legal movement.<br>
Except for the knight, which may jump over pieces, pieces cannot move through pieces of either colour without either<br>
stopping (in the same of a piece of the same colour) or capturing them (in the case of a piece of the opposite colour).<br><br>
**How to capture pieces:**<br>
If a piece lands on a space with an opponent’s piece, that piece is captured and removed from the board.<br>
Pieces cannot be placed on the same square as a piece of the same colour. When a piece captures an opponent’s piece,<br>
it must finish its current move action and end the player’s turn.<br><br>
**How to move chess pieces:**<br><br>
**Pawn**<br>
Pawns move one square forward in a straight line. They cannot move horizontally, diagonally or backwards.<br>
An exception to this is if a pawn is yet to be moved during the game. If a pawn has not yet moved,<br>
it may be moved two squares forward as a single move. Both squares must be empty.<br>
The player can also choose to move the piece a single square.<br>
The only time a pawn may move diagonally is when capturing an opponent’s piece.<br>
Pawns may capture an opponent’s piece on either of the diagonal spaces to the left or right ahead of the piece.<br>
As part of capturing the piece, the pawn will move diagonally to replace the captured piece.<br>
A pawn cannot capture an adjacent piece on any other square, or move diagonally without capturing.<br><br>
**Rook (Castle)**<br>
The rook, sometimes called the castle, can move any number of squares horizontally along its current row (rank) or column (file).<br>
It cannot pass through pieces of the same colour, and can capture pieces of the opposite colour by moving onto an occupied space.<br>
It cannot move diagonally for any reason.<br><br>
**Knight**<br>
Knights are the only chess piece that may be moved ‘through’ other pieces by ‘jumping’ over them.<br>
It captures pieces as normal by landing on a space occupied by a piece of the opposite colour<br>
and cannot move to a square occupied by a piece of the same colour, but may move over pieces of either colour during its move.<br>
Knights move in a fixed ‘L’ pattern: two squares forward, backward, left or right, then one square horizontally or vertically,<br>
or vice versa - one square forward, backward, left or right, followed by two squares horizontally<br>
or vertically to complete the ‘L’ shape.<br>
This means that the knight can always move to the closest square that is not on its current row (rank),<br>
column (file) or directly adjacent diagonally.<br><br>
**Bishop**<br>
The bishop can move any number of squares diagonally - this means it always moves along the diagonal line of squares<br>
matching the current colour of its square. This means that each player begins the game with one bishop<br>
that can move on each colour. A bishop cannot move horizontally or vertically for any reason.<br>
It cannot move through pieces of the same colour, and captures a piece of the opposite colour by moving onto its square.<br><br>
**Queen**<br>
The queen may move any number of squares horizontally, vertically or diagonally.<br>
These movements must be made in a single straight line during a single turn.<br>
(In other words, you can’t move three squares diagonally, followed by three spaces vertically.)<br>
The queen cannot move through pieces of the same colour, and captures a piece<br>
of the opposite colour by moving onto its square.<br><br>
**King**<br>
The king moves a single space horizontally, vertically or diagonally.<br>
The king cannot move into a space that would grant a check or checkmate to the opponent player.<br>
As an exception to all other chess pieces, the king is never captured - a player loses the match<br>
when the king is placed into checkmate, which would lead to an unavoidable capture on the opponent’s next turn.<br>
The knight must move the full distance - it cannot move just two squares in a straight line<br>
without also moving one to the side, for instance.<br><br>
**What is check and checkmate?**<br>
When a piece moves in a way that would allow a player to capture the opponent’s king on their next turn,<br>
the attacking player typically announces “check”.<br>
The player placed into check must move their king or move another piece to stop the attack on their next turn- either<br>
by blocking the move or capturing the attacking piece.<br>
If a player creates a situation where their opponent cannot stop their king from being captured on the next turn,<br>
the attacking player announces “checkmate” and immediately wins the game.<p>

## Advanced chess rules:
**How to promote a pawn:**<br>
If a pawn reaches the opposite edge of the board - the farthest row (rank) from the controlling player- it is<br>
promoted to another piece: a rook, knight, bishop or queen.<br>
The new piece replaces the pawn on its current square, and follows the movement rules for the respective piece.<br>
While most casual players use captured pieces to represent promoted pieces,<br>
a pawn can legally be promoted to any piece regardless of whether it has been captured.<br>
For example, a player may have multiple queens as the result of promoting pawns,or multiple bishops able to move<br>
along diagonal lines of the same colour depending on the square on which the pawn was promoted.<br>
There is no limit to the number of pawns that can be promoted.<br><br>
**What is En passant?**<br>
En passant - French for ‘in passing’ - is one of the most famous moves in chess.<br>
En passant occurs when a pawn moves two squares forward as the result of its optional starting move.<br>
If an opponent’s pawn would have been able to legally capture the moving pawn had<br>
it only moved one square instead of two, the opponent can declare en passant on their next turn<br>
and move their pawn diagonally onto the square that the pawn passed through- capturing<br>
the pawn as if it had only moved one square.<br>
En passant must be declared and made as the opponent’s next turn to be legal- otherwise,<br>
the player with the chance to capture the pawn loses the opportunity.<br><br>
**What is Castling?**<br>
Castling is permitted when a player’s king piece and a rook have not yet moved during the game.<br>
Castling can be performed with either rook, as long as they haven’t moved- in other words,<br>
they are still in their starting corners on the edge closest to the controlling player.<br>
Castling involves a player moving the king piece two squares towards the rook with which they are castling,<br>
before moving the rook to the square that the king moved ‘through’.<br>
This effectively puts the rook adjacent on the other side of the king, while the king moves two squares<br>
towards the space in which the rook started the game. Regardless of whether castling is performed<br>
with the rook closer to the king (kingside) or one square further away (queenside),<br>
the king only ever moves two spaces.<br>
The king cannot be used in a castling manoeuvre if it is currently in check,<br>
but a rook can be used in castling even if it is under threat from an opponent’s piece- in other words,<br>
if it could be captured on the opponent’s next turn,<br>
or on any of the squares it passes through while performing the move.<br>
As usual, castling cannot be used to move the king if it would put the king into check.<br>
Castling also cannot be used if there are any pieces between the king and the rook- the<br>
squares between must be clear.
